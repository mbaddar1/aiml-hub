# LLM-Arena

**_The open benchmarking and tuning enabler frameworks for local LLMs._**

---

## 🎯 Purpose

With the explosion of open source Large Lanugate Models (LLMs) (1.7M+ models on hugging face) , having the ability and the knowledge to : 
1. Select the best base model for your application that suits your budget

2. Tune the model to customize it for your business needs

3. Evaluate the tuned model

Is a superpower. This repo aims to enable individuals and SMEs to bridge this GAP by a series of Jupyter Notebooks and code snipptes.
